[10:06 PM] tizilogic: it sure untangled a knot I had in my head for a few days now
[10:49 PM] tizilogic: @Sander ecs_set_object? I can't find such a macro or function. is that just pseudo code or should there be a macro/function with that name?
[10:51 PM] Sander: oops, ecs_set_pair_object
[10:51 PM] Sander: the difference with ecs_set_pair is that the type you set is determined by the 2nd element of the pair, not the first
[10:51 PM] tizilogic: gotcha
[10:52 PM] tizilogic: thx for clearing that up üëç
[10:54 PM] Sander: this part of the manual describes in more detail how component types & relations work: https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/blob/master/docs/Relations.md#relation-components
