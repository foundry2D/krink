[![Android](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/android.yml) [![iOS (Metal)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/ios-metal.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/ios-metal.yml)

A ECS driven library that provides G2 functionality to render textures,
fonts and SDF shapes using Kinc.

While technically it should be extremely portable, principal focus is put
on supporting iOS and Android.
