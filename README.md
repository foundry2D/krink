# krink - custom G2 lib on top of Kinc

[![Android](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/android.yml) [![iOS (Metal)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/ios-metal.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tizilogic/krink/actions/workflows/ios-metal.yml)

ECS driven library that provides G2 functionality similar to the one
[Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) provides, to render textures, fonts and SDF shapes using
[Kinc](https://github.com/Kode/Kinc).

While technically it should be very portable (given it's based on
[Kinc](https://github.com/Kode/Kinc)), principal focus is put on supporting iOS and Android.

## Note

This is very much a work in progress in a very early stage and the API is very likely to
change/break as work on it continues.
